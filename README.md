# Duck Maze Game

Welcome to the Duck Maze Game! In this game, you'll guide a duck through a series of increasingly challenging levels, avoiding dangerous lava while navigating water and ice tiles, moving boxes, collecting powerups, and more!

## Game Overview

In this game, the duck moves on a board with tiles of various types. The goal is to navigate through 5 levels, each with different grid configurations and increasing difficulty. The board consists of empty tiles, water, lava, ice tiles, boxes, and collectibles. The duck must avoid lava and use various powerups and game mechanics to progress.

### Key Features:
- **5 Levels of Difficulty**: Each level has a different grid matrix, creating a unique challenge.
- **Water and Lava**: Water tiles allow the duck to swim, but lava kills the duck if it comes in contact with it.
- **Lava and Water Interaction**: When lava touches water, the tile turns into a wall.
- **Ice Tiles**: When the duck touches ice, it continues moving in the same direction until it hits a non-ice tile.
- **Boxes**: The duck can push boxes around to block lava spread. If a box touches lava, it turns it into a wall.
- **Timer Fields**: These tiles turn into lava after a certain number of moves. Boxes can prevent this by covering the timer field.
- **Collectibles**: Collect items scattered across the board to earn points.
- **Powerups**: There are two types of powerups:
  - **Immunity**: The duck is immune to lava for a limited number of moves.
  - **Lava Stop**: Stops the lava from spreading for a limited number of moves.
- **Portals**: Teleport the duck to the next level after completing the current one.

## Gameplay
